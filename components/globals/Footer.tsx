        This app is designed to identify and help resolve a wide range of a11y
        issues during development. It is not a complete solution to
        accessibility-compliance. Proper testing also involves real-life user
        interaction and emulating screen-reader and keyboard navigation in your
        applications using a local build prior to production.

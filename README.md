An accessibility-focused, typesafe Next.js frontend stack, built using TypeScript, Next.js (App router), Storybook, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn, Playwright, React Hook Form, Zod and Husky.

Modular | Semantic | Extensible

- Enforces proper, accessible HTML across components using correct semantics and aria attributes
- TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier Zod schema validation and code formatting all work together
